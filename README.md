* When was the company incorporated?

Founded in 2017 in Oakland, CA

* Who are the founders of the company?

Attila Toth and Kumar Dhuvur 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Frequent natural disasters displace families, devastate communities and drive financial loss. Zesty.ai uses artificial intelligence to understand the impact of climate risk to each and every building

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Received 13mm in 2018 for a total of 

## *Business Activities*:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

The company is trying to avoid huge financial loss that arise from natural disasters and has devastating impact to communities and the economy in general. Lower loss ratios, risk-adjusted premiums, increased market share, better reinsurance terms and an enhanced customer experience are necessary in order to achieve the goal.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Any offices, factories, buildings, houses, owner in zones at high climate risk where natural disaster are likely to happen and bring destruction are Zesty.AI potential customers.  

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Zesty.ai’s property risk analytics platform uses 200 Bn data points, including aerial imagery, weather and real estate data to understand the impact of climate risk to each and every building.  Zesty.ai leverages artificial intelligence for modeling the built environment in 3D and simulating the impact of natural disasters, such as wildfires, severe convective storms and flood events. Currently, they are implementing the Z-3D: the insurance industry’s first 3D property intelligence system. This new technology allows carriers to assess unique building characteristics like roof pitch, the number and size of roof facets, building height, parcel slope, and more, to precisely measure risk at an individual property level for both personal and commercial lines of business. With more than 150 million properties in true-to-life renders, Z-3D  brings a new generation of AI-based insights to insurers for improving the speed and accuracy of nearly every aspect of the property insurance lifecycle. 


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

INSURTECH: Insurtech refers to the use of technology innovations designed to squeeze out savings and efficiency from the current insurance industry mode

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

Insurtech is a data-hungry business, and the development of IoT, Advanced Analytics, Big Data, and AI
have led to a massive reshape of the entire domain. The massive amount of data available allowed carriers to understand their clients more deeply, resulting in new product categories, more personalized pricing, and increasingly real-time service delivery. Through Machine Learning, carriers have had access to models that are constantly learning and adapting to the world around them—enabling new product categories and engagement techniques while responding to shifts in underlying risks or behaviors in real time.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Most important competitors include: Oscar, Root Insurance, Hippo.
I did not include Insurtechs' companies that operate in the health insurance, but only those that insure objects (homes, cars, buildings, etc.)


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Being ZESTY.AI a NEW STARTUP, they have not published any financial result and thus it is difficult to measure their success so far.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

IMAGINATION: On the commercial side, expanding partnership with leading insurance carriers, reinsurers, and MGAs in order to implement its capacity on catastrophe risk assessment, property insights, and property condition monitoring. On the technology side, opening new technological HUBs in order to be always well positioned to attract local talent in computer vision and data science, with the unique goal of developing and implementing the technologies that are required for the digital transformation of the insurance industry. On the service side, creation and use of a blockchain that might be useful for further speed up instantaneous payments and remove transaction fees.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Partnering would implement Zesty.AI's capacity of assessing catastrophe risk, property insights, and easier accessibility to property condition monitoring. Moreover, Zesty.AI might utilize data from partners. Opening new technological HUBs would help Zesty.AI to attract talents in the technological field and would help the company to implement its technologies as well as better prepare talents in the specific field the company operates in. The blockchain platform would speed up payment processes and cutting transaction fees eventually, providing an advantage for both the company and the customers.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

My suggestions are all based on already existing and utilized technologies, expcept for the blockchain. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Blockchain would eventually become useful, if not essential, since the insurance industry is shifting to a faster and faster environment. Insurance in the future will very likely decided in one click and the possibility of having a faster, more convenient method of payment would save time, money, energy.
